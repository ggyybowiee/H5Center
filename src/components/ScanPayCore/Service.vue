    <div class="content">
      <p>We allows you to access certain premium features or content in exchange for a one-time or recurring fee, as
        applicable to the relevant features or content (collectively, each a “Paid Service” and collectively the "Paid
        Services"). Your transactions and any other use of the Paid Services are subject to these Paid Service Terms of
        Service.</p>
      <br>
      <p>1. Your Acceptance</p>
      <p>By using a Paid Service, you signify your agreement to (1) these Paid Service Terms; and (2)We Terms of
        Service,Privacy Notice, and Community Guidelines applicable to your geographic location, and all other terms and
        conditions that generally apply to the We website. We’ll refer to these documents together as the “Terms”.
        Please read the Terms carefully. If you do not understand the Terms, or do not accept any part of them, then you
        may not use the Paid Services.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Each time you place an order for a Paid Service (including when you order individual subscriptions or items of
        content), you enter into a separate contract for services on these Terms. When you complete a purchase, you
        signify that you wish to enter into a binding contract for the provision of the applicable Paid Services.</p>
      <br>
      <p>2. Payment, Refund and Cancellation Policy</p>
      <p>Payment:We accepts payment via the current payment method indicated prior to purchase, which may include Paypal
        Payments and any other form of payment that we make available to you from time to time. You must have a valid
        accepted form of payment on file in order to purchase Paid Services or participate in free trial offers or other
        free offers related to the Paid Services. You agree to abide by any relevant Terms of Service or other legal
        agreement (including without limitation the Paypal Payments Terms of Service), whether with We, or a third
        party, that governs your use of a given payment processing method. Prices for any Paid Service may change at any
        time, and We does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional
        offering. You agree to pay for any Paid Service that you order. We will charge your credit card or other form of
        payment for the price listed on the relevant Paid Service offer, along with any additional amounts relating to
        applicable taxes, bank fees and currency fluctuations. If you purchase any automatically renewing subscriptions,
        you agree that We will charge the payment method on file on the first day of each billing period for the
        relevant subscription, and if the payment method on file becomes invalid due to an expired credit card or other
        similar reason and we are unable to charge you on the next billing period, We reserves the right to immediately
        revoke your access to any Paid Service you have ordered until you update your payment method. If you fail to
        update your payment method within a reasonable amount of time, We may cancel your subscription.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Taxes: If We is required to collect or pay any taxes in connection with your purchase of a Paid Service, such
        taxes will be charged to you at the time of each purchase transaction. Additionally, if required by law, you are
        responsible for reporting and paying certain taxes in connection with your purchase and use of a Paid Service.
        Such taxes may include duties, customs fees, or other taxes (other than income tax), along with any related
        penalties or interest, as applicable to your purchase or country of purchase.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Pre-Orders: We may offer the ability to pre-order certain items of content available within the Paid Services.
        When you place a pre-order for an item of content, unless otherwise noted at the time of purchase, your
        transaction will be completed and your credit card will be charged on the date when the relevant item of content
        is made available to you. You can cancel your pre-order at any time up to the point at which the relevant item
        of content becomes available. In some cases, We may need to cancel a pre-order you have placed, in which case we
        will notify you.</p>
      <br>
      <p>3. Accessing Paid Services.</p>
      <p>Device and Usage Requirements. Certain types of Paid Services may require you to use a device that meets the
        system and compatibility requirements for such Paid Service, which may change from time to time. For further
        information on supported devices and technical requirements, Send mail to us.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Additionally, your use of the Paid Services is subject to the We Paid Service Usage Rules, which describe how
        you may access or use the different types of Paid Services on We (e.g., applicable viewing periods and device
        limitations).</p>
      <br>
      <p>Geographic Restrictions. The Paid Services, and certain content available within the Paid Services, are
        currently available only in some countries. You agree that you will not present any false, inaccurate, and you
        will not attempt to circumvent any restrictions on access to or availability of the Paid Services or content
        available within the Paid Services.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Other Paid Services. You may receive access to other subscription products or purchases as part of a
        transaction for certain We Paid Services (e.g., by purchasing a movie on We). Additionally, you may receive
        access to certain We Paid Services as part of a purchase of, or subscription to, other products. Your use of any
        We Paid Service is governed solely by these Paid Service Terms, and not the terms of any other product,
        including any other product through which you receive access to a We Paid Service.</p>
      <br>
      <p>4. License</p>
      <p>Your use of the Paid Services must be only for personal, non-commercial use. You agree not to use any Paid
        Service, in whole or in part in connection with any public presentation even if no fee is charged (except where
        such use would not constitute a copyright infringement). You are receiving a non-exclusive license to access the
        Paid Service and all rights, title and interest in the Paid Services (including any content offered through the
        Paid Services) not expressly granted to you in these Terms are reserved by We and its licensors. If We
        reasonably determines that you violated any of the terms and conditions of the Paid Service Terms, your rights
        will immediately terminate and We may terminate your access to the Paid Service and/or your We account without
        notice and without refund to you.</p>
      <br>
      <p>5. Restrictions</p>
      <p>When you use the Paid Service, you may not (or attempt to):</p>
      <p>* use the Paid Service in an illegal manner or for an illegal purpose;</p>
      <p>* share your We account password with someone else to allow them to access any Paid Service that such person
        did not order;</p>
      <p>* copy, sell, rent, or sublicense the Paid Services to any third party;</p>
      <p>* circumvent, reverse-engineer, modify, disable, or otherwise tamper with any security technology that We uses
        to protect the Paid Service or encourage or help anyone else to do so;</p>
      <p>* access the Paid Service other than by means authorized by We; or remove any proprietary notices or labels on
        Paid Services.</p>
      <br>
      <p>6. Changes</p>
      <p>Changes or Discontinuation of Paid Services. We reserves the right to change the availability of Paid Services.
        In addition, we reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any Paid Service with or without notice to
        you and we will not be liable to you or any third party for any such modifications, suspension, or termination.
        However, this will not affect your ability to request a refund as described above.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Removal or Unavailability of Content. In certain cases, content available within a Paid Service may become
        unavailable due to restrictions from our partners who license us such content or other legal or policy reasons.
        We will have no liability to you for any such unavailability. In the case of video rentals and purchases, if
        this happens during your rental period or during the first five years after you purchase content, you may
        request either a refund of the price paid or a reasonable replacement for such otherwise unavailable rental or
        purchased content. For all other Paid Services, if you are not able to download a copy of the affected content
        (if applicable) before it becomes unavailable, then We may, at its option and solely as an accommodation to you,
        offer you either (a) a reasonable replacement of the content if possible or (b) a refund of the price of the
        content. If We chooses to issue you a refund or replacement, the refund or replacement of your purchase price
        shall be your sole remedy.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If the Paid Service Terms change, you will have the opportunity to review the new terms when you next purchase
        any Paid Service. By completing the purchase, you signify your agreement to the new Paid Service Terms, and
        further, that they will apply to your use of the Service as a whole (including any Paid Service you have
        purchased in the past) and all subsequent purchases (until the Paid Service Terms change again). If you refuse
        to accept the updated Paid Service Terms then you may not buy any additional Paid Services and the latest
        version of the Paid Service Terms that you accepted will continue to apply to your use of previously purchased
        Paid Services.</p>
      <p>7. Communications</p>
      <p>Communications. By using the Paid Services, you consent to receiving communications from us including marketing
        communications such as newsletters about We features and content, special offers, promotional announcements, and
        customer surveys, to your registered email address or via other methods. </p>
